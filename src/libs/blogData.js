      <p>Several traditional processes remain central to our production:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hand-formed body panels using English wheel techniques</li>
        <li>Solid walnut dashboard inlays crafted by third-generation woodworkers</li>
        <li>Leather upholstery stitched using saddle-making techniques from the 1920s</li>
        <li>Hand-brushed metal finishes that develop a unique patina over time</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Each Soft Roots truck carries the soul of American manufacturing excellence, with over 200 hours of hand craftsmanship invested in every vehicle that rolls off our production line.</p>
